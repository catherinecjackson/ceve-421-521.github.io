# Refresher

## Course organization

1. Module 1: background knowledge (climate risk, etc.)
1. Module 2: quantitative tools for decision-making under uncertainty
1. Module 3: getting more philosophical and practical

### The problem

@abraham_demandforecasts:2020 show that water utilities systematically over-estimate future demand.
Using a single, certain, forecast of future water demand might motivate over-building infrastructure.

### Robustness

We want to make choices / design infrastructure that are **robust** to errors in demand forecasts.

## Definition

> The insensitivity of system design to errors, random or otherwise, in the estimates of those parameters affecting design choice [@matalas:1977]

Mathematical definitions differ dramatically, however [@@herman_robustness:2015]!
Today we will discuss some overlapping perspectives and ideas about robustness.

## Bottom-up analysis

::: {.incremental}
1. **Top-down, certain:** experts develop a "best" forecast of future conditions, then choose a design that is optimal under that forecast
1. **Top-down, uncertain:** experts assign likelihoods to uncertain states of the world, then choose a design that optimizes expected performance [@herman_robustness:2015]
1. **Bottom-up:** first **explore** to identify SOWs a solution is vulnerable to, then assess likelihood (more Wednesday!)

# Robustness metrics

## Taxonomy

![@herman_robustness:2015](../_assets/img/herman_robustness_2015_fig1.png)

## Regret

Regret measures how sorry you are with your choice.
There are two main definitions [@herman_robustness:2015]:

::: {.incremental}
1. Deviation of a single solution in the real world or a simulated SOW from its baseline (expected) performance
1. Difference between the performance of a solution in the real world or a simulated SOW and the best possible performance in that SOW
:::

## Satistficing

Satisficing measures whether solutions achieve specific minimum requirements, condensing performance into a binary "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory".

::: {.incremental}
1. With many SOWs, many studies use a **domain criterion**: over what fraction of SOWs does a solution satisfy a performance threshold [@herman_robustness:2015]?
1. *Note:* this is equivalent to asking what is the probability that a solution satisfies a performance threshold, although many people who calculate robustness metrics are allergic to the word "probability"
1. More complex satisficing criteria: see @mcphail_robustness:2019.
:::

# Critiques and alternative perspectives

## Parameters?

::: {.fragment}
The robustness metrics we've seen are defined in terms of parameters: we have a model with parameters, and we define SOWs as different values of those parameters.
:::

::: {.fragment}
Is this a good way to quantify our conceptual ideas about robustness?
:::

## Combinations of uncertianties

In practice, we often have a combination of parametric uncertainties and "model structure" uncertainties [@doss-gollin_subjective:2022].
And **not all SOWs are equally likely**!

Climate scenario uncertainties are "deep" (more next week!), but it would be a mistake to say we don't know _anything_ and all futures are equally likely [@hausfather_scenarios:2020]

### Alternative perspective

::: {.incremental}
1. Using "prior beliefs" assign likelihoods to different SOWs
1. Use quantiative toolkit (optimization, sensitivity analysis, etc.)
1. Vary prior belefs: a solution that is robust to different **probability distributions** rather than to different **parameter values**.

## Exam 2

- Exam 2 was scheduled for 3/22
- It will be postponed to 3/29
- 3/22: review session
- Lake problem lab will be postponed to 4/5
- I will have Exam 1 graded by 3/22 so you know where you stand!

## Final project

In your final project, you will add something that's misisng to the house-elevation problem.
This might be:

- More complexity / realisim for a model component (e.g., depth-damage function, nonstationary storm surge probability, household financial constraints, etc.)
- A new model component (e.g., a better decision alternative, etc.)
- Applying a decision tool from class (e.g., sequential decision analysis, robustness checks, etc.)

Timeline coming soon -- don't worry about Canvas for now.
