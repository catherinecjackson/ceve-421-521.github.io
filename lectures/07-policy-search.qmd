# Overview

## Review of notation

::: {#fig-notation}
![](../_assets/img/bayes-rdm-I.png)

Notation for our system dynamics.
:::

## Key components of an optimization problem

::: {.incremental}
1. Objective function
1. Constraints
1. Decision variables
:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
## Reflect
To what extent is this [in]consistent with exploratory modeling?
:::

## Why optimize?

#### Large action spaces (many decision variables) make it difficult to find the best solution by trial and error.

::: {.callout-important .fragment}
Today we'll say _optimization_ but even an exact solution is only optimal in our model, not the real world.
I prefer the term _policy search_ which emphasizes the use of computers to suggest promising strategies.
:::

# Optimization in the wild

## Where have you seen optimization used?

::: {.callout-tip}
## Reflect

Take 2-3 minutes, then share.
:::

## Linear programming {.smaller}

- $\min f(x) \quad \textrm{s.t.} \quad g(x)$
- $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are linear functions: $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_n x_n$

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
```{julia, lp-sketch}
#| echo: false
x = 2:0.1:11
f1(x) = 4.5 .* x
f2(x) = -x .+ 16
f3(x) = -1.5 .* x .+ 12
f4(x) = 0.5 .* x

p = plot(
    x,
    max.(f3(x), f4(x));
    fillrange=min.(f1(x), f2(x)),
    color=:lightblue,
    grid=true,
    legend=false,
    xlabel=L"$x_1$",
    ylabel=L"$y$",
    xlims=(-2, 20),
    framestyle=:origin,

plot!(-2:0.1:20, f3.(-2:0.1:20); color=:brown, linewidth=3)
plot!(-2:0.1:20, f4.(-2:0.1:20); color=:purple, linewidth=3)

1. **Limitations:** requires strong assumptions (is linearizing your function a good approximation?)
1. **Strengths:** very fast (can scale to large problems)
1. **Examples:** how much should each pump in a water distribution network be run at a given time step to maintain pressure?

## Linear programming with discrete decisions

::: {.incremental}
- Fixed costs create discontinuitites in the objective function
- Example: which electricity generators should be on/off?
- Need to create new indicator variables which flag on/off status: $\mathbb{I}_i = \begin{cases} 0 & \textrm{off} \\ 1 & \textrm{on} \end{cases}$.
- Can be solved with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
:::

## Gradient descent
If you have a differentiable function, you can use gradient descent to find the minimum.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=50%}
$$
\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \mathbf{x}_n - \alpha \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_n)
$$

## Simulation-optimization

::: {.incremental}
- **Strengths:** can handle complex, non-linear systems (model can be a black box)
- **Limitations:** slow ("guess and check"), rely on "heuristics" to decide a solution is good enough
- **Examples:** design of water resource systems under uncertainty
:::

::: {.callout-tip .fragment}
We'll  use simulation-optimization in our lab next week.

# Wrapup

## Key points

::: {.incremental}
1. Optimization can be used at a high level (e.g., system design) or can be embedded in a problem (e.g., operations at each time step).
1. Every optimization problem has an objective and decision variables. Many have constraints.
1. Optimization is a field, with many techniques.
1. In this course, I want you to understand and critique how optimization problems are framed in the wild. Take other courses to focus on the techniques.
:::

## Wednesday

We will discuss @@schwetschenau_optimizing:2023.
Discussion questions are [posted](../readings/week-07-reading.qmd).
Please focus on the framing of the problem and the assumptions made when you read; don't get bogged down in the technical details.
