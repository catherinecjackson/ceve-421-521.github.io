# About the course

## Course goals

Climate risk management is a very broad field.
We will:

1. **Survey** how it is implemented in different fields
1. Develop a **deep understanding** of how to assess proposed climate risk strategies
1. **Apply** these methods to a real-world problem

## The syllabus is online!

- Course website: [https://ceve-421-521.github.io/](https://ceve-421-521.github.io/)
- Syllabus: [https://ceve-421-521.github.io/syllabus/](https://ceve-421-521.github.io/syllabus/)
- Read it! (and confirm on Canvas)
- Questions? Ask now or later!

## Course organization
### Module 1: introduction
1. Introduction
1. Science of climate hazard
1. Vulnerability, exposure, and impacts
1. Systems

## Course organization
### Module 2: decision analysis
1. Cost-benefit analysis
1. Scenario analysis
1. Policy search and optimization
1. Multiobjective policy search
1. Sequential decision problems

## Course organization
### Module 3: thinking critically
1. Robustness
1. Deep uncertainty
1. Equity and justice
1. Financial and systemic risks
1. Reflections

## Class structure

### Mondays

- Lecture
- Take notes and ask questions
- Slides posted by Sunday night (or earlier, though minor changes Monday morning possible)
- To print, follow the official [Quarto instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf))

## Class structure

### Wednesdays

- Short and easy reading quiz to start
- Student-led reading discussion
- Do the reading and participate in the discussion (including to ask questions!)

## Class structure

### Fridays

- Lab.
- Make significant progress in class.
- Due at the start of next lab.

## Acommodations

If you have a documented disability, scheduling conflicts, or otherwise need accommodations, please let me know as soon as possible

Viruses are circulating and everyone's immune system is different.
If you need others to wear a mask to protect you, please let me know -- no health disclosures needed.

## Academic integrity

- AI/ML resource policy in the syllabus
- Rice Honor Code
- See some [examples](https://viveks.me/climate-risk-analysis/lecture-notes/01-overview/index.html#26) from Vivek Srikrishnan (Cornell) and Tony Wong (RIT)
- If in doubt, ask!

## A community of learning

- We all benefit from a diverse, safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment
- Analysis is not value neutral -- we will discuss how to think critically about the assumptions and values underlying our work, and their implications
- Assume good faith of others and engage in good faith yourself

## Pre-requisites

We will use quantitative language and ideas to frame ideas.
The only formal pre-requisite is a first course in probability / statistics

Exposure to some of the following will be helpful:

- Engineering economics
- Programming
- Climate science
- Engineering design

## Grading
### Weekly readinhg quizzes (10%)

- Designed to be easy if you do the reading
- 5 minutes at the start of discussion days
- Will drop the lowest two

## Grading
### Labs (10%)

- Graded for completion only:
    - 3: complete
    - 2: missing important parts
    - 1: barely tried
    - 0: nothing
- Solutions will be posted. **You are responsible** for going through solutions.

## Grading
### Tests

- In-class exams
- I'll try to make them straightforward!

## Grading
### Project (30%)

- Labs will build on each other to create a final project
- Your task is to add something new to the project
- Present during final exam block

## Grading
### Reading discussion (10%, 521 only)

521 students will lead one reading discussion.
Contact me to schedule!

### Reading notes (10%)

- Everyone will take notes once during the semester on a reading discussion.
- I will share sign-up info.
- Groups allowed as needed.

# Software tools

## Tool overview

In this class, we will use

1. Julia
1. GitHub
1. Quarto
1. VS Code (suggested)

## Why Julia?

::::: {.incremental}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width=50%}
- Syntax
    - Readable to computers and humans
    - Closely parallels math notation
- Designed for numerical and scientific computing
:::

::: {.column width=50%}
- Fast! 
    - "Two language problem"
    - All you need is Julia
- Open source
:::
::::
:::::

## Julia example

A (naive) implementation of the Fibonacci sequence:

```{julia}
#| echo: true
function fib(n)
    if n < 2
        return n
    else
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    end
end
fib(10)
```

## GitHub

1. You need a GitHub account
1. Code is stored in "repositories"
1. `clone` a repository to your computer
1. Make changes and `commit` them
1. `push` your changes to GitHub
1. Using GitHub classroom, instructors can view your code

## Quarto

Quarto is a tool that allows you to combine text and code and create many types of output

- This website is made with Quarto
- You will use Quarto to create reports for labs
    - Everything in one place
    - No running code, save a figure to `Downloads`, copy into Word, then update your code and try to remember where to paste it
- Reproducible

## VS Code

1. VS Code is a text editor
    1. If you are an advanced user of another text editor, you can use that instead, but I recommend VS Code
1. VS Code can work as a Julia IDE

## Resources

See the [resources page](../resources.qmd) for links to tutorials and other resources!

# Logistics

## Reading

For Wednesday:

- Three news articles on flood risk management
- Come prepared for a discussion on Wednesday
- Reading quiz should be very easy if you do the reading

## Lab 1

- Generally no advance preparation needed
- For our first lab, we will be installing required software for the course.
- Please start working on this lab as soon as possible so that we can use Friday's lab session to troubleshoot any issues and review the material.
